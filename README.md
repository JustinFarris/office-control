# office-control
some bits of code to control my desk and work environment

## desk_control_toggle:
 Toggles a motorized sit/stand desk between sitting position and standing position.
 Hardware/Circuit Requirements:
   (2) 5v coil, 20V+/0.5A+ relay (or some electrically activated switch/transistor that matches the values of your desk controls)
   (1) motor-controlled desk with a simple 2-direction, 3-conductor control interface
   (1) normally-open momentary switch
   (2) normally-open reed switches
   (2) arrays of (14) 6.4mm x 1.8mm disc neodymium magnets taped to max/min
   wires and cables and stuff
   (I used:
     - A leviton-type RJ45 jack to connect the circuit to the controller
     - 3.5mm stereo jacks to connect the button to the circuit

 This would be more efficient/expensive with:
   - reed switches at the max and min points
   - some way to directly measure height/distance.
